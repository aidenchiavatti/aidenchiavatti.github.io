## Pebble Activity Watch App (PACT)

A smartwatch app that provides the user with the optimal times to perform various types of activities, given a users schedule and future weather conditions. It allows the user to verbally request the best time to do an activity. This request is processed by the server, which returns a list of optimal times to be displayed by the watch.

## ATM.go


An Android app that provides customers with the ability to preemptively input withdrawals and deposits from the comfort of their home or on the go. Upon reaching the bank they will simply need to input a code provided through the app and use the facial recognition feature to verify their identity and the ATM will have already processed and prepared their withdrawal or deposit. Furthermore, we utilized the location services provided through the API to alert customers about the location of the nearest bank/ATM.
